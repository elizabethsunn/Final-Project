# Final-Project
Hello and welcome to my final project! In this project, I attempt to use BLAST, Homology structure modeling with SWISS-MODEL, and NGlviewer to answer the question of what makes Remdesivir efficavious towards both Ebola virus disease and COVID-19 based on the similarities and differences between their viral polymerase structures. 

Above, you'll find the final jupyter notebook, the FASTA file containing EBOV RdRp protein sequence, the results of the EBOV RdRp Protein BLAST, the PDB file containing the SARS-CoV-2 structure from Protein Data Bank, as well as the PDB files of the four EBOV RdRp models I created.
