# Final-Project
Hello and welcome to my final project! In this project, I attempt to use BLAST, Homology structure modeling with SWISS-MODEL, and NGlviewer to answer the question of what makes Remdesivir efficavious towards both Ebola virus disease and COVID-19 based on the similarities and differences between their viral polymerase structures.
